## why antibody?

It makes it easy to load plugins from github repos.
Also has functionality for auto-updating plugins.
It's faster than zgen by ~90ms.
The plugin script is simple to read, unlike zgen. 

Total startup time with antibody is ~390ms (dynamic, static saves an additional 10ms). 

## why prezto?

Currently trialling it as an alternative to oh-my-zsh. Seems lighter weight.
