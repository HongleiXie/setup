## why antibody?

It makes it easy to load plugins from github repos.
Also has functionality for auto-updating plugins.
It's fast because it uses a static plugin script, and faster than zgen.
The plugin script is simple to read, unlike zgen. 

Total startup time with zgen is ~390ms. 

## why prezto?

Currently trialling it as an alternative to oh-my-zsh. Seems lighter weight.
